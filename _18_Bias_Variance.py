Bias vs Variance

for low fit model or overfit model(High curve) , the training error is very low infact it is 0 . 
but test error varies with very high if we choose differ overfit strategies . This is high variance .
since train error is low , hence called low bias .


for high fit model or underfit model(straight line) , traing error will be significant . so high bias .
And the test error will also be significant , but do not varies much , hence low variance .


Bias -> think about train error 
Variance -> think about test error


for Balanced fit model the bias and variance are both low .

How to get Balanced fit model ?
1. Cross Validation
2. Regularization
3 . Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
4. Ensemble Methods (Bagging , Boosting)
